# oldcod-source

Old call of duty decompilations using [Atian Call of Duty Tools](https://github.com/ate47/atian-cod-tools), please create an issue on the tools directory if you find a strange decompiled code.

Yes, I know that for some the code after the preprocessor is available. But this repository is about testing the decompiler, not to give access this kind of content.

Dumps:

- `bo4_1.0.0_vm34` PS4 dump of the 1.0.0 version of Black Ops 4
- `bo4_pre2017_vm31` PS4 dump of a pre version of Black Ops 4
- `bocw_pre2020_vm37` PC dump of a pre version of Black Ops Cold War
