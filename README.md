# oldcod-source

Old call of duty decompilations using [Atian Call of Duty Tools](https://github.com/ate47/atian-cod-tools), please create an issue on the tools directory if you find a strange decompiled code.

Yes, I know that for some the code after the preprocessor is available. But this repository is about testing the decompiler, not to give access this kind of content.
